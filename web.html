<p>
<b>POVERTY:
Poverty is a complex and multidimensional condition characterized by a lack of resources, both material and non-material, needed to meet basic human needs for a minimum standard of living. This includes insufficient income, lack of access to education and healthcare, limited opportunities for economic and social participation, and often living in conditions of poor housing and inadequate sanitation.
</b></p>
<p><b>
The effects of poverty are far-reaching and impact various aspects of individuals' lives. Here are some ways in which poverty affects people:
<ul>
<li>Limited Access to Education: Poverty often restricts access to quality education. Children from impoverished families may face barriers such as lack of school fees, uniforms, and necessary supplies. Limited educational opportunities can perpetuate the cycle of poverty across generations.</li>
<li>Poor Health Outcomes: Individuals living in poverty often face inadequate healthcare and nutrition. Limited access to medical services, nutritious food, and clean water can lead to higher rates of illness and lower life expectancy.</li>
<li>Unemployment and Underemployment: Poverty is closely linked to unemployment and underemployment. Limited job opportunities, particularly those that offer fair wages and job security, can make it difficult for individuals and families to escape poverty.</li>
<li>Housing Insecurity: Many people in poverty live in substandard and overcrowded housing conditions, lacking proper sanitation and basic amenities. This can contribute to health issues and overall well-being.</li>
<li>Social Exclusion: Poverty can result in social exclusion and marginalization. Individuals in poverty may face discrimination, stigmatization, and limited social opportunities, which can impact their mental and emotional well-being.</li>
<li>Food Insecurity: Poverty often leads to inadequate access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. This can result in malnutrition, affecting physical and cognitive development, particularly in children.</li>
<li>Limited Access to Financial Resources: Individuals in poverty may lack access to banking and financial services, making it difficult for them to save, invest, or secure loans. This limits their ability to build assets and escape the cycle of poverty.</li>
<li>Increased Vulnerability to Disasters: Those living in poverty are often more vulnerable to the impacts of natural disasters and economic shocks. Limited resources make it challenging for individuals and communities to recover from such events.</li>
</ul></b></p>
<b><p>WICKED PROBLEM STATEMENTS:</p>
    <p>Certainly! Here are five challenging problem statements related to poverty alleviation that can be addressed using AI for good:
<ul>
   <li> Targeted Microfinance Allocation: Develop an AI-driven system that can accurately identify and recommend microfinance loans to individuals in underserved communities, taking into account their financial history, risk factors, and potential for income generation.</li> 
    <li>Job Matching for Vulnerable Populations: Create an AI-powered platform that matches job seekers from marginalized backgrounds with suitable job opportunities by analyzing their skills, education, and location, while considering employers' requirements and socio-economic conditions.</li> 
    <li>Predictive Healthcare for Poverty-Stricken Areas: Build a predictive healthcare model using AI that can anticipate disease outbreaks, healthcare resource needs, and potential health risks in low-income regions, enabling proactive intervention and resource allocation.</li> 
    <li>Agricultural Productivity Enhancement: Develop AI-driven tools that provide small-scale farmers in impoverished regions with insights on optimal crop planting, irrigation schedules, and pest management, aiming to increase agricultural productivity and food security.</li> 
   <li>Financial Literacy and Inclusion: Create an AI-driven virtual assistant or chatbot that offers personalized financial education and guidance to people with limited access to traditional banking services, helping them make informed financial decisions and access essential financial services.</li> 
</ul>

                        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a term attracting significant attention from both research as well as practice. AI is a constantly evolving frontier of emerging computing capabilities and technologies including but not limited to autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, robots, and virtual agents. The impact of AI has been examined in various business as well as non-business contexts, including the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the United Nations. However, due to the mixed findings of various studies, the exact nature of AI on specific SDGs is not clear. We combine quantitative and qualitative reviews of the extant academic literature to examine the impact of AI on an important SDG – alleviation of poverty. This study has multiple potential contributions - we identify the key trends in the extant research in this domain and also open up the black box of intermediate mechanisms through which AI affects poverty alleviation.</p>

                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) could help humanity achieve the ambitious goal of eradicating extreme poverty. The United Nations (UN) General Assembly, in its declaration Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, boldly proclaimed the aspirations of the nations of the world to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere.” No Poverty is the first of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, humanity is not on track to accomplish this ambitious goal; the COVID-19 pandemic has increased joblessness and economic disruption pushing additional millions into extreme poverty and rolling back the gains in poverty alleviation over the past three decades. This paper briefly explores the theoretics of poverty, recent trends in management education, and emerging innovations in AI. It provides some examples of AI implementation in the agriculture sector and draws inferences from these diverse but coalescing transformations in AI, management education, and sustainable development.</p>

                        <p>The first task for eradicating poverty is accurate poverty identification. Deep poverty identification is conducive to investing resources to help deeply poor populations achieve prosperity, one of the most challenging tasks in poverty eradication. This study constructs a deep poverty identification model utilizing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify deeply poor households based on the data of 23,307 poor households in rural areas in China. For comparison, a logistic regression-based model and an income-based model are developed as well. We found that our XAI-based model achieves a higher identification performance in terms of the area under the ROC curve than both the logistic regression-based model and the income-based model. For each rural household, the odds of being identified as deeply poor are obtained.Important characteristics that can be used to identify deeply poor households include household income, disability, village attributes, lack of funds, labor force, disease, and household members.</p>
